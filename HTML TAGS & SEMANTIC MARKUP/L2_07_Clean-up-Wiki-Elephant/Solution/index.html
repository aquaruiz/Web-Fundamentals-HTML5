    <p>The <b>elephants</b> are the large mammals forming the family <a>Elephantidae</a> in the order <a>Proboscidea</a>. Three species are currently recognised: the <a>African bush elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>), the <a>African
    forest elephant</a> (<i>L. cyclotis</i>), and the <a>Asian elephant</a> (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Elephants are scattered
    throughout <a>, <a>, and <a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now
        extinct, members of the order include <a>, <a>mammoths</a>,
        and <a>
            <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also
                called a <a>incisors</a> grow into tusks,
                which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear
                flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a>
                    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a>savannahs</a>, forests, deserts, and <a>keystone
                    species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their
                    distance from elephants while predators, such as <a>,
                        <a>wild dogs</a>, usually target only young elephants (or "calves"). Elephants
                        have a <a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows")
                            tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several
                            related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a>matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.
                        </p>
                        <p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with
                            other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a
                            state of increased <a>,
                                which helps them gain <a>infrasound</a>, and <a> over long distances. Elephant <a>intelligence</a>
                                has been compared with that of <a>. They appear
                                    to have <a> for dying
                                        or dead individuals of their kind.

                                    Elephants are used as <a> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often
                                        controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a>circuses</a>. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in
